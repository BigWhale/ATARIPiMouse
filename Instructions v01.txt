v0.1

WARNING: There is the possibility of damaging both your hardware and yourself doing this sort of thing. Please be careful and 
be aware on this sort of project, errors in software CAN AND WILL damage hardware!

PREREQUISITES:

You have actually hooked up your raspberry PI to your ATARI ST with a suitable cable as specified in "Atari to Raspberry Pi Cable v01.jpg" to your raspberry Pi. 
You can get pinouts on the web, I have included the one I used called "Raspeberry Pi3 connector Pinout.png"

1) Install Minibian to the MicroSD card using the instructions provided at: https://minibianpi.wordpress.com/

2) Log-in using your keyboard

3) Install a WIFI driver if you need it (Rpi3) using your ethernet wire:

apt-get install firmware-brcm80211 pi-bluetooth wpasupplicant

4) Configure the WIFI, use a guide like: https://gerge.ly/how-tos/raspberry-pi-3-b-minimal-setup/ or whatever you can find that works!

5) Update the system:

apt-get update
apt-get upgrade

6) Install a c compiler:

apt-get install gcc

7) We can install the WiringPi GPIO interface (as documented here http://wiringpi.com/ ) using: 

apt-get install wiringpi


8) Go to https://github.com/backofficeshow/ATARIPiMouse and get mouseIO.c

9) Copy mouseIO.c to somewhere suitable on the file system (I use /root) from Github

10) Compile using:

	gcc -Wall -o mouseIO mouseIO.c -lwiringPi

11) Test it out by running ./mouseIO.c

12) Your mouse movements (from a mouse plugged into your Pi) should be reflected on your ATARI screen.

13) Follow this guide on how to make your mouse program boot automatically on powerup: https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-how-to-run-a-command-when-boots-up.html

14) Tweet me at how you got on (if its good news!) and let me know how you have made it better!



Have Fun!
